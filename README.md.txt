# FFMPEG Subtitle Extractor

A **very** quick and dirty GUI wrapper made with Rust to extract the text subtitles of a video file using FFMPEG. Used for my other project

## Instalation 

Just [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) in your current OS and clone the repo. FFMPEG is also required and in the system path.

## Running

Just run `cargo run` inside the repo folder.
